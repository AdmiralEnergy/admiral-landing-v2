**Release checklist**

- [ ] One sticky header at top on load + scroll
- [ ] Hero CTA jumps to `#lead`
- [ ] Submit test -> shows in **Netlify  Forms  lead-intake**
- [ ] Visit with `?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=test&utm_content=hero` and resubmit -> UTMs captured
- [ ] Phone field: type / insert mid-string / backspace across `)` & `-` / paste -> no focus jumps; formats on blur
- [ ] `/advisor` loads and navigates normally (no router dependency in header)
- [ ] Mobile check (iOS Safari) -> no zoom on focus; form is usable end-to-end

(Optional) Tiny polish before promote
1) Thank-you redirect

Add one hidden input to your visible form component (LeadIntakeForm.tsx):

<input type="hidden" name="redirect" value="/thank-you" />

2) GA4 submit ping (keeps HTML-first)

Drop near the end of index.html, before </body>:

<script>
  document.forms['lead-intake']?.addEventListener('submit', () => {
    window.gtag?.('event','lead_submit',{form:'lead-intake'});
  });
</script>

3) Netlify notifications (1 min)

Netlify  Forms  lead-intake  Notifications  add your email/Slack so you see real leads immediately.

Promote game plan

Review the preview on #24 using the checklist above.

When its green, merge to main and Promote to production (keep auto-publish off until youre happy).

Do one live test submit from production. Confirm it appears in Forms with UTMs.

Want me to hand you a one-liner patch for the redirect + GA4 bits you can commit on the same branch?
