VS Code / Codex Kickoff Prompt — Admiral Energy /advisor MVP

Role: Senior full-stack dev (Vite + React + TS + Tailwind v3).
Branch: feat/advisor-mvp
Goal: Implement the /advisor MVP flow per docs/ADVISOR_DEV_GUIDE.md.

Tasks:

Routing

Add lazy route /advisor and AdvisorApp shell with stepper (1–4).

State

Create src/routes/advisor/state.ts with AdvisorState (see guide), Context or Zustand if already installed; otherwise Context.

Persist to LocalStorage key advisor:v1.

Steps

Build 4 step components in src/routes/advisor/steps/ with validation and Next/Back.

Block Next until valid; show inline helper text.

UI

Tailwind card layout, brand colors (navy/gold/off-white), mobile-first.

Top stepper (active state).

Forms

Add hidden Netlify form advisor-intake; on final submit, mirror state to hidden inputs and submit.

Analytics

Create src/config/analytics.ts with track() and redditLead() helpers.

Fire advisor_step_view on each step mount.

Fire advisor_submit_success and Reddit Lead on success.

UTM capture: on initial load of /advisor, parse location.search into localStorage.utm.

Quality

TypeScript strict, no new deps.

Ensure /advisor builds and runs locally; no console errors.

Output:

Provide a full diff for created/changed files.

Include run-steps for QA: npm install && npm run dev, path to /advisor, how to trigger a test submission, where to see Netlify Forms entry.

Confirm no package.json changes unless strictly necessary.

Acceptance:

Compiles on Node 22

Netlify Forms receives entry (field names match spec)

GA4 event visible in Realtime; Reddit Pixel Lead fires
