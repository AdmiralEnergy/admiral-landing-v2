Remove duplicate <Header /> from landing page (layout owns header).

Add hidden static Netlify registration form to index.html so lead-intake is always detected.

Replace hero calculator/catalog with a single CTA to #lead.

Keep HTML-first (uncontrolled) form for stability; phone formats on blur.

Safety: keep Netlify auto-publish OFF until preview is verified.

Acceptance criteria

Exactly one sticky header at the top.

Hero shows one CTA  takes you to #lead.

Form submits to Netlify Forms (lead-intake) and includes UTM fields when present.

Build is green; preview loads on mobile + desktop. (See <attachments> above for file contents. You may not need to search or read the file again.)
